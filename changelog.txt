v1.1
both parsers now call the "setup" method which does the work.
the first method inside setup removes the orders which are made for products that dont exist.
it builds a set of productIDs and then removes the bad orders using lambda.

there is now a User class that holds the number of orders (might remove, we have order list size),
number of cancelled and modified orders, total amount spent and order list.

the next method builds a user map (userID -> User, same as other maps).

//TODO
parse XMLs (probably Roey)

for each product, calculate the total amount bought (done when we have final version of orders)
and calculate the average amount- need to save for each product how many valid orders were made for it.
